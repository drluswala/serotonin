     <p class="intro">Although they are the smallest of the big cat species, leopards are still a powerful force to be reckoned with. In particular, their skulls are notably large and their jaws are so powerful that they can take prey much larger than themselves.

       <p class="brief">Compared to other wild cats, the leopard has relatively short legs and a long body with a large skull. Its fur is marked with rosettes. It is similar in appearance to the jaguar, but has a smaller, lighter physique, and its rosettes are generally smaller, more densely packed and without central spots.
